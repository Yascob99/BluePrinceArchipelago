<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If you are a player, there's no installation instructions yet. If you are developer please check out the <a href=#installation>Installation</a> section.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you have Bepinex 6 installed as we need the IL2CPP support.
* [Bepinex 6](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)

### Installation

2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Yascob99/BluePrinceArchipelago.git
   ```
3. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
4. If nuget didn't install the required dependencies, you will need to run the following to install these packages by running these commands in the **project** folder.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Development Roadmap

- Rooms
    - [x] Ability to change initial draft pool and dynamically add back in rooms to the pool.
    - [x] Add ability to add extra copies of rooms to the pool
    - [ ] Add better handling of certain rooms that rely on other events to be added to the pool (eg. Morning Room)
    - [ ] Add ways of better handling upgraded rooms.
- Items
    - [ ] Create AP assets for replacement unique item locations
    - [ ] Handle recieving items mid-run and remove it from the appropriate inventories.
    - [ ] Handle Junk item rewards.
- Reverse Engineering
    - [ ] Find events to hook to track if a run is ongoing so items and traps, and deathlinks can be applied at the proper times.
    - [ ] Find out how shops choose their inventory and how to change it based on our items.
        - [ ] Find out how to add checks that can be bought at a randomized price (for other players).
    - [ ] Look into how the trading post functions and how to handle replacing the tradeable items with AP versions when appropriate.
    - [ ] Find a place to hook for trunk goals.
- Goals
    - [ ] Find where to hook for specific goals being achieved.
- Archipelago
    - [ ] Create the logic for handling events from the AP server.
    - [ ] Create a reconnect logic that will reconstruct as much of the state as possible from the Data from the AP Server.
    - [ ] Create a way of storing run specific data in case of a game crash. (eg which save file, any queued checks, any temporary effects applied to the current day)
- UI
    - [ ] Create a better looking UI
    - [ ] Add a menu option for Archipelago Mode on creating a new file.
- Potential Long Term Goals
    - [ ] Check the ease of changing puzzles like the Mora Jai puzzles for use in future optional modes.
    - [ ] Add in the ability to swap in first enter room checks for a physical item hidden inside each room.
